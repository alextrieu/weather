## Introduction
I built this weather app as part of my journey to learn web development, specifically focusing on working with APIs, rendering data on a webpage, and using custom hooks to manage state. One of the main features of this app is its ability to fetch and display weather data from an external API, using JavaScript's fetch() method to make a network request and retrieve the data. I also learned how to use try...catch statements to handle errors that might occur when working with external APIs.

In addition to building the app, I also used this project as an opportunity to practice my skills in HTML and CSS, creating a clean and intuitive user interface that makes it easy to access the weather data. By building this weather app, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of web development concepts and technologies, while also creating a practical tool that can be used by myself and others to check the weather in real-time.
